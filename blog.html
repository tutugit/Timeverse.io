                        <p>Hey everyone,</p>
                        <p>I just wanted to share a few things about the upcoming Stardew Valley Cookbook. If you
                            haven’t heard about it yet, there’s an official cookbook coming out on May 14, 2024,
                            published by Penguin Random House.</p>
                        <p>It’s been in the works for quite some time!</p>
                        <p>The cookbook features more than 50 recipes from the game (adapted to work in your real life
                            kitchen), including some of Stardew Valley’s unique fare like the Lucky Lunch, Strange Bun,
                            Seafoam Pudding, Pink Cake, and much more. The recipes (which, in keeping with the game, are
                            either pescatarian, vegetarian, or vegan) were all developed by Susan Vu.</p>
                        <img src="https://picsum.photos/800/600?id=1" alt="">
                        <p>The book features lots of great photography, as well as fun & beautiful illustrations from
                            Kari Fry, who has produced a ton of Stardew Valley’s official artwork, perhaps most well
                            known from the Stardew Valley Guidebook. And the writing in the book is done by Ryan Novak
                            (also of the Stardew Valley Guidebook) and myself. Each recipe has a unique introductory
                            write-up, sometimes from the residents of Pelican Town, and sometimes from the illustrious
                            Queen of Sauce. It’s also chock full of quotes and appearance from the various denizens of
                            Stardew Valley.</p>
                        <p>One of the things that I’ve always been happy about, is when Stardew Valley acts as a focal
                            point for people to bond over, develop friendships, and find inspiration in their everyday
                            lives. What better way to achieve that than to bring Stardew Valley to life in your very own
                            kitchen? I’m really looking forward to seeing the dishes people will cook!</p>
                        <p>You can find a <span>free sample recipe here.</span></p>
                        <p>Eating this one will add +3 Luck to the rest of your day.</p>

                        <p>Thanks for playing Stardew Valley!</p>
